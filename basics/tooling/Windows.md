# Basic software I use on Windows machines

## ninite 

*Disclaimer: not strictly windows software I still feel it belong here.*

Install or upgrade most Muggle software (Skype, Java Muggle Edition etc) easier and withot the risk of accidentally misreading the double deny the "really sure you want to not install Ask toolbar?" checkbox.

## cmder

**cmd** replacement. 

Provides:
* portable - add to a folder on dropbox or usb stick and never look back
* tab completion
* history like in bash
* ctrl-r
* drop your binaries (fossil, jq etc) in the bin folder and they are instantly available everywhere you use dropbox or your usb key
